                            Usually, when you see a number after a clue in parenthesis, it's either the enumeration/length of the answer, or an index into the answer. Given that there is two of them, one is probably an enumeration and the other is probably an index. And by probably, in this case, I mean definitely. Of course, dealing with the +Ï€ is another issue.
