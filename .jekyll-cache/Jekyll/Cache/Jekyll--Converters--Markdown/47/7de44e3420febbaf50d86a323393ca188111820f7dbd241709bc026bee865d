  <li><strong><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpya11a?Everyman-Minis-Magus-Arcana">Everyman Minis: Magus Arcana</a></strong> - I was asked to come up with more magus arcana, a topic that has been covered a lot in a lot of different places. I found a ripe place to dig for interesting designs - asking the magus to use different weapons.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9zm0?Everyman-Minis-Alchemical-Power-Components">Everyman Minis: Alchemical Power Components</a></strong> - This document contains more ways to use your alchemical items to power up spells. This includes the famous <em>vomit sphere</em>.</li>

In II, I wrote Prof. Laeroth Rydel, the dorkiest dhampir occultist. In IV, I wrote Groulindar, an unfettered eidolon who is fighting for the freedom of other eidolons.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/149417/Legacies-ToS104-House-of-Mirrors?manufacturers_id=5904">ToS 1-04 House of Mirrors</a></strong> - This is a module I wrote for the Legacies OP campaign, and was my attempt of making a Pathfinder murder mystery that works with the rules, as opposed to against them.</li>
