  <li><strong><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpya11a?Everyman-Minis-Magus-Arcana">Everyman Minis: Magus Arcana</a></strong> - I was asked to come up with more magus arcana, a topic that has been covered a lot in a lot of different places. I found a ripe place to dig for interesting designs - asking the magus to use different weapons.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9zm0?Everyman-Minis-Alchemical-Power-Components">Everyman Minis: Alchemical Power Components</a></strong> - This document contains more ways to use your alchemical items to power up spells. This includes the famous <em>vomit sphere</em>.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9tk8?Everyman-Minis-Esoteric-Implements">Everyman Minis: Esoteric Implements</a></strong> - This document contains more esoteric implements for the Occultist, expanding on a class with very few additional materials.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9k85?Villain-Codex-II-Adversaries-for-Advanced-Heroes">Villain Codex II</a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9t0t?Villain-Codex-IV-Monsters-for-Meddlesome-Heroes">Villain Codex IV</a></strong> - This was a series where multiple different designers submitted villains to form a bank of statblocks for Game Masters. In II, I wrote Prof. Laeroth Rydel, the dorkiest dhampir occultist. In IV, I wrote Groulindar, an unfettered eidolon who is fighting for the freedom of other eidolons.</li>
