    <h1>TOO FAQ? AFOOT!</h1>
    <h2 class="question">What is all this?</h2>
    <p class="answer">This is the website where your team can register for the 2022 MIT Mystery Hunt! See the <a href="https://www.mit.edu/~puzzle/">Mystery Hunt website</a> for more background on and history of the Hunt.</p>

    <h2 class="question">When and where will the Hunt take place?</h2>
    <p class="answer">This year's Hunt will be held remotely. It will begin at noon ET on Friday, January 14th, 2021. Wrap-up will take place at noon ET on Monday, January 17th, 2021.</p>

    <h2 class="question">Is there a deadline to register?</h2>
    <p class="answer">TK.</p>

    <h2 class="question">Should I still come to MIT’s campus for the Hunt?</h2>
    <p class="answer">No. MIT’s campus might be closed, and there will be nothing in the Hunt that requires or encourages the presence of solvers on campus. We discourage gathering for this Hunt anywhere with meaningful numbers of COVID-19 cases. You will be able to enjoy the Hunt in the same way from any location with internet access.</p>

    <h2 class="question">Will you have tips to help our team with online collaboration?</h2>
    <p class="answer">Yes! Last year's running team, ✈️✈️✈️ Galactic Trendsetters ✈️✈️✈️, will run an online How-To-Hunt workshop on Monday, December 21 at 8pm ET with a special focus on online collaboration tools. We'll also link to a recording here after it happens. Stay tuned to this page for details.</p>

    <h2 class="question">How do you win?</h2>
    <p class="answer">As always, the first team to find the coin will be the winner.</p>

    <h2 class="question">What about the coin this year though?</h2>
    <p class="answer">Correct, finding the coin is how you win.</p>

    <h2 class="question">What is the prize for winning?</h2>
    <p class="answer">The coins you found. Plus, your team will be forced to plan, write, and run the 2023 Hunt.</p>

    <h2 class="question">Will there be any differences in the size or scope of this Hunt?</h2>
    <p class="answer">No. We expect this Mystery Hunt to be commensurate in size with recent Mystery Hunts.</p>

    <h2 class="question">Will there be any Mystery Hunt merchandise?</h2>
    <p class="answer">tk</p>

    <h2 class="question">Are there any team size restrictions?</h2>
    <p class="answer">No, you may register teams of any size. Similar to recent Hunts, we believe teams with many more than 75 people may have less fun. Mystery Hunt has a very large scope, but we're working to make it an amazing experience for both small and large teams.</p>

    <h2 class="question">Is this event still related to MIT?</h2>
    <p class="answer">Yes! This is still the MIT Mystery Hunt, organized through MIT Puzzle Club, and it will feature plenty of MIT-specific content. MIT familiarity will help you succeed in the Hunt, and MIT students are especially encouraged to participate!</p>

    <h2 class="question">Do I need to be affiliated with MIT to participate?</h2>
    <p class="answer">No. We believe everyone who likes puzzles will enjoy the Hunt, and we invite them to participate! However, we encourage any experienced teams who expect they may win the Hunt to have current MIT students on their team, especially as the writing team must have students on it; see the registration form for more details.</p>

    <h2 class="question">How can I support the Mystery Hunt?</h2>
    <p class="answer">Registration for the Mystery Hunt is free, but there are a number of ways you can help support us. In particular, if you would like to donate to the Mystery Hunt fund, you may do so using <a href="https://giving.mit.edu/form?fundId=2720842">using MIT fund ID 2720842</a>.</p>

    <h2 class="question">What if I have other questions?</h2>
    <p class="answer">Please feel free to email us at  <a href="mailto:puzzle@mit.edu">puzzle@mit.edu</a> with any additional questions.</p>

    <h2 class="question">Is anything on this registration website a puzzle?</h2>
    <p class="answer">Please don't solve my masters' project. 6* 3 1 6; A feeder about the Roman Goddess of Night 4 2 3*, 1 6; A feeder about a type of bug. 4 2 3*, 1 6; ... then what is it? 4, 2* 3 1 6; A feeder about a Valve game. 4 2 4* 6; ... is instead a red herring. 4, 2* 3 1 6; Make a feeder into a baby! 4 2 "3* 1 6"; A feeder about the Turner who led a rebellion. 4 2 3*, 1 6</p>
