### Instructions

{% include spoiler.html id="One" name="Section 1 - There's a problem with entering the word in the grid." content="If a word already has it's alphabetically earliest letter in the first position, then when you enter it in the grid, there is no change. This is okay." %}
{% include spoiler.html id="Two" name="Section 2 - There's a problem with entering the word in the grid." content="You can enter a palindrome in the grid in reverse. Doesn't change much, but you can do it." %}
{% include spoiler.html id="Three" name="Section 3 - There's a problem with entering the word in the grid." content="When an answer undergoes the Second Great Vowel shift, that does mean that any Es in the answer change to Es. Theoretically, if there was an answer word that had only Es as vowels, that means that it wouldn't change." %}
{% include spoiler.html id="Four" name="Section 4 - There's a problem with entering the word in the grid." content="If there's no duplicate letters, that means that no letters are removed before entering them in the grid." %}
{% include spoiler.html id="Five" name="Section 5 - There's a problem with entering the word in the grid." content="You can replace a NATO alphabet letter with the word that represents its first letter in the NATO alphabet. Just means that it doesn't change much." %}
{% include spoiler.html id="Six" name="Section 6 - There's a problem with entering the word in the grid." content="Then you did something wrong. These should all enter regularly." %}
{% include spoiler.html id="Seven" name="Section 6 - There's something weird with ordering these clues." content="I mean, have you seen the rest of this puzzle? This shouldn't be too surprising." %}

## Answers

{% include spoiler.html id="Eight" name="Grid" content="<img src=\"images/Unnecessarily Complex Answer Grid.png\">" %}
{% include spoiler.html id="Nine" name="Variety Parts" content="Some of the clues need to be transformed to be solved. The instructions tell you to transform the answers too before putting them in the grid, but it turns out that the transformations don't actually do anything. <br> <br> Section 1 - Answers need to have the alphabetically-first letter moved to the front, but they're already the first letter. For extraction, this means that you're taking the first letter of each relevant clue.<br> 7A - IRK - T<br> 15A - AVID - H<br> 32A - DEIMOS - E<br> 24D - ABIDE - M<br> <br> Section 2 - Answers need to be reversed before entering, but they're all palindromes, so that doesn't change anything. For extraction, you take the position of the first R, but all of them start with the letter R, so you take the first letter of each relevant clue. (We didn't mean to make them all start with R, that was just a happy accident that we used.)<br> 1A - REPAPER - O<br> 23A - RACECAR - R<br> 1D - RADAR - E<br> 6D - ROTATOR - T<br> <br> Section 3 - Answers need to have their vowels replaced with the letter E before entering, but all their vowels are already Es. The indicated number is ELEVEN, so the ones digit is 1, so you take the first letter of each clue.<br> 17A - RETWEETED - H<br> 2D - ELEVEN - I<br> 12D - SESTETS - N<br> 26D - ELECT - G<br> <br> Section 4 - Answers need to have their duplicated letters removed before entering, but they have no duplicated letters. Since you aren't removing any letters, the extraction instructions just extract the first letter of each clue every time.<br> 14A - POTAGE - S<br> 28A - OBELISK - C<br> 8D - RAGED - H<br> 19D - IRONED - A<br> <br> Section 5 - Answers need to be replaced with NATO letters, but they're already NATO letters. Since you're not changing the word anymore, the extraction instructions just extract the first letter of each clue every time.<br> 9A - ALFA - N<br> 36A - DELTA - G<br> 4D - PAPA - E<br> 27D - LIMA - T<br> <br> Section 6 - Answers don't need to be changed for this one, but there is a complicated ordering method. If you follow the complicated ordering, all it does is rearrange the clues and then put them back in clue order, then extract the first letter of each clue.<br> 11A - AROMAS - H<br> 13A - DEAN - E<br> 16A - ADAGES - M<br> 19A - INHALE - O<br> 21A - ONZE - R<br> 27A - LET - E<br> 30A - IDS - T<br> 31A - NICE - H<br> 34A - EDICT - E<br> 35A - LLANO - Y<br> 37A - SOGGY - S<br> 3D - A AND W - T<br> 5D - ERODE - A<br> 7D - IMAGE - Y<br> 10D - FAITH - T<br> 18D - EL CID - H<br> 20D - EASELS - E<br> 22D - ZEDONG - S<br> 25D - CECIL - A<br> 29D - KILO - M<br> 33D - SOY - E<br> <br> Combine all of these parts together to get the answer phrase THE MORE THINGS CHANGE THE MORE THEY STAY THE SAME, an appropriate description of how this puzzle worked." %}
