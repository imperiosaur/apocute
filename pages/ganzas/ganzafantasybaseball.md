## Context

This set of puzzles was written over Christmas break in 2018 as a MIT Mystery Hunt warm-up. The puzzles were designed to be straightforward, but the metapuzzle was designed to be harder than a traditional metapuzzle. In particular, this was created to put out feelers for doing something different with metapuzzles than normal.

## Hints

### Al Kaline

{% include spoiler.html id="One" name="I don't know where to start!" content="It looks like a geometry puzzle because it is. You can get through a lot of it by just using the Pythagorean Theorem. Start with solving for α." %}
{% include spoiler.html id="Two" name="I can't get δ" content="The sine ratio can help you here." %}
{% include spoiler.html id="Three" name="I can't get ϵ" content="Similar triangles can help you here." %}
{% include spoiler.html id="Four" name="I don't know how to extract!" content="The values of the greek letters sure are integers less than 26." %}

### Andy Pettitte

{% include spoiler.html id="Five" name="I don't know where to start!" content="These clues can be tricky to break into. The bottommost clue is one of the easier ones to break into. The phrase you are coming up with is not a common phrase, but you may have heard of it before depending on how much you've delved into certain types of wordplay. Each of the \"1\"'s in the enumeration is \"A\"." %}
{% include spoiler.html id="Six" name="I have some of the phrases, but I don't know why I'm getting them." content="Hmmm. Each phrase sure has a lot of repeated letters..." %}
{% include spoiler.html id="Seven" name="I know why the phrases are special, but I don't know how to extract!" content="What's the most interesting part of a palindrome?" %}

### Deacon White

{% include spoiler.html id="Eight" name="I don't know where to start!" content="There doesn't appear to be any vowels in these words. Perhaps you should add them back in. The second one should hopefully look a little familiar even without the vowels." %}
{% include spoiler.html id="Nine" name="I don't recognize some of the lists" content="The first one is not the deadly sins, but there's a thematically similar set with a lot of similar elements. The second one is about time. The third one for you is probably right at hand. The fourth one is in the cards. The fifth one deals with a particular fictional family. \"VNTRPP\" is the last name of the family. The sixth one is from a video game series." %}
{% include spoiler.html id="Ten" name="I've ID'd the lists, but I don't know what to do now." content="There seem to be some missing elements." %}
{% include spoiler.html id="Eleven" name="I don't know how to extract!" content="Look at the first letters. Don't forget, this was about adding back in vowels to words where they were missing." %}

### Mike Trout

{% include spoiler.html id="Twelve" name="I don't know where to start!" content="Start counting." %}
{% include spoiler.html id="Thirteen" name="I can't find a particular animal!" content="Okay." %}
{% include spoiler.html id="Fourteen" name="I don't know how to extract!" content="Each row is a set of three numbers where each number is a 0, 1, or 2. This implies a certain kind of code. <a href=\"http://www.puzzledpint.com/files/2415/7835/9513/CodeSheet-201912.pdf\">Click here for a reference if that's not ringing bells for you.</a>" %}

### Mikey "Starz" Yastrzemski

{% include spoiler.html id="Fifteen" name="I don't know where to start!" content="Look at the title of this puzzle. Mikey Yastrzemski doesn't have the nickname \"Starz\", so we obviously added that for a reason. What's so special about \"Mikey Starz\" compared to \"Yastrzemski\"? Do that with these phrases. In most cases, there is only one working word. If there is more than one word, it won't matter for extraction." %}
{% include spoiler.html id="Sixteen" name="I don't know how to extract!" content="You did something with one letter in each case. That letter seems important." %}

### Norman Osborn

{% include spoiler.html id="Seventeen" name="I don't know where to start!" content="These look like trivia questions because they are. Answer the trivia questions. Don't be afraid to search things up on the internet. You're allowed to use whatever resources you like." %}
{% include spoiler.html id="Eighteen" name="I don't know how to extract!" content="Those numbers next to the categories are the indices that you need. The trick is assigning them." %}
{% include spoiler.html id="Nineteen" name="I did everything correct, but I'm not getting a word." content="The answer to this puzzle is a word from a work of fiction. You've likely got the second answer wrong. (There's a frequent misconception with that question.)" %}

### Pete Rose

{% include spoiler.html id="Twenty" name="I don't know where to start!" content="The clues at the top of each of the pictures should have a pretty clear answer. (Or at least, the first couple do.) Now compare those words to the pictures underneath them." %}
{% include spoiler.html id="TwentyOne" name="That wasn't helpful." content="Different parts of the picture refer to different letters in the word clued above them. You can use logic to find out which parts of the picture applies to which parts of the word." %}
{% include spoiler.html id="TwentyTwo" name="I don't know how to extract!" content="The picture in the bottom right doesn't have a clue on top of it. What could be on top of it?" %}

### Robert Clement

{% include spoiler.html id="TwentyThree" name="I don't know where to start!" content="This is a cryptic crossword. Each of the clues is a cryptic crossword clue." %}
{% include spoiler.html id="TwentyFour" name="Okay, but I still can't solve them." content="There is a letter missing in each clue." %}
{% include spoiler.html id="TwentyFive" name="I don't know how to extract!" content="There is a letter missing in each clue." %}
{% include spoiler.html id="TwentySix" name="I did that, and it isn't a word." content="All of the letters that were missing in the clue came from a certain part of the word. You're going to have to do a similar transformation on this word to get an actual word." %}

### Willie Mars

{% include spoiler.html id="TwentySeven" name="I don't know where to start!" content="These sound like advertising slogans. Seem if you find some advertising slogans that are similar to these." %}
{% include spoiler.html id="TwentyEight" name="I did that, but I still don't know what to do!" content="Let's take a look at the first slogan. You should have the candy slogan that it is close to. What do you use to clean a floor. Start listing them out. One of them should be similar to one of the words of the candy." %}
{% include spoiler.html id="TwentyNine" name="I don't know how to extract!" content="Each of these joke candies is one letter off of the real candy." %}

### Metapuzzle

{% include spoiler.html id="Thirty" name="What is this?" content="This puzzle needs the answers to the other nine puzzles in order to solve them. That being said, you'll be able to solve it even without all the answers - you just may need to do some Wheel of Fortuning." %}
{% include spoiler.html id="ThirtyOne" name="How do I get started?" content="There's an empty column on the table that says \"Position\". Maybe you should figure out what position that each player is playing." %}
{% include spoiler.html id="ThirtyTwo" name="I can't figure out how to get that from the answers." content="Good. There is nothing in the answers that tell you that. The puzzles themselves will tell you." %}
{% include spoiler.html id="ThirtyThree" name="Wait, how does that work?" content="Take a look at Norman Osborn. He's not a baseball player. Who is he? Go research it if you don't know. Once you've done that, his identity should be similar to many of the things in his puzzle. What's a two-word phrase that would be a category that fits Norman Osborn and everything in his puzzle? That has a specific meaning in Baseball - well for one specific team in the Northeastern United States. That item has one position that it's much closer to than others. That's Norman's position. Each of the puzzles has a link to a position like this one does." %}
{% include spoiler.html id="ThirtyFour" name="How does Mike Trout's position work?" content="How were the letters encoded? (This is a bad pun.)" %}
{% include spoiler.html id="ThirtyFive" name="Howganz does Robert Clement's position work?" content="One baseball position can obliquely describe the transformation that has happened to one word in each of the clues. (This is probably the weakest connection out of all of them, but this position was hard to do.)" %}
{% include spoiler.html id="ThirtySix" name="How does Andy Pettitte's position work?" content="Which letters were the most important in this puzzle? What are some ways of describing those? Which of those is also a baseball position?" %}
{% include spoiler.html id="ThirtySeven" name="How does Willie Mars' position work?" content="Each of the items in this puzzle are slogans for candy. Come up with other words for slogan until you get something related to baseball." %}
{% include spoiler.html id="ThirtyEight" name="How does Al Kaline's position work?" content="What kind of triangles are featured in this puzzle? (In particular, while there are many types of triangles in this puzzle, what kind did you use to solve the puzzle?)" %}
{% include spoiler.html id="ThirtyNine" name="How does Norman Osborn's position work?" content="He's not a baseball player. Who is he? Go research it if you don't know. Once you've done that, his identity should be similar to many of the things in his puzzle. What's a two-word phrase that would be a category that fits Norman Osborn and everything in his puzzle?

{% include spoiler.html id="Forty" name="How does Pete Rose's position work?" content="What do each of the pictures feature. Come up with words to describe that until you come up with a baseball term." %}
{% include spoiler.html id="FortyOne" name="How does Mikey \"Starz\" Yastrzemski's position work?" content="You did something to one letter in each row. Come up with words to describe that action until you come up with a baseball term." %}

{% include spoiler.html id="FortyThree" name="I've gotten all the positions, but I don't know what to do then." content="Each position in baseball has a number associated with it." %}
