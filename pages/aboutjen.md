In addition to puzzle writing, I write RPG materials and dabble in game design.

## Puzzles

- **[Escape the Eldritch Garden](https://www.escapethispodcast.com/e/season-5-episode-10-the-eldritch-garden-ft-jen-mcteague/)** and **[Podcast this Escape](https://www.escapethispodcast.com/e/podcast-this-escape-the-eldritch-garden-ft-jen-mcteague/)** - This is an audio escape room that I created and then ran for the hosts of Escape this Podcast. Feel free to listen to the podcast, then grab the notes and run the room for your friends!
- **[Difficult Choices](https://inkubatorcrosswords.com/)** - This was my regular crossword debut, and was written for The Inkubator!

## RPG Writing

- **[Pathfinder #140: Eulogy for Roslar's Coffer (backmatter)](https://paizo.com/products/btq01x4b?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-140-Eulogy-for-Roslars-Coffer)** - I wrote the Melacage, a giant incorporeal undead ball of confusion and depression.
- **[Paizo Unchained](https://paizo.com/threads/rzs2u9od?8i-Paizo-Unchained#1)** - This was a joke scenario I wrote for April Fools 2017 where you fight against various members of the Paizo staff.
- **[Everyman Minis: Magus Arcana](https://paizo.com/products/btpya11a?Everyman-Minis-Magus-Arcana)** - I was asked to come up with more magus arcana, a topic that has been covered a lot in a lot of different places. I found a ripe place to dig for interesting designs - asking the magus to use different weapons.
- **[Everyman Minis: Alchemical Power Components](https://paizo.com/products/btpy9zm0?Everyman-Minis-Alchemical-Power-Components)** - This document contains more ways to use your alchemical items to power up spells. This includes the famous *vomit sphere*.
- **[Everyman Minis: Esoteric Implements](https://paizo.com/products/btpy9tk8?Everyman-Minis-Esoteric-Implements)** - This document contains more esoteric implements for the Occultist, expanding on a class with very few additional materials.
- **[Redesign Rasputin Contest](https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5li1q?He-Lives-He-Dies-He-Lives-Again)** - This was a contest that ran on Paizo to redesign Rasputin using the Occult Adventures book that had just come out. I won with an absolutely ridiculous stat block, and this was the reason why I have a Gom-Gom avatar.
- **[Villain Codex II](https://paizo.com/products/btpy9k85?Villain-Codex-II-Adversaries-for-Advanced-Heroes) and [Villain Codex IV](https://paizo.com/products/btpy9t0t?Villain-Codex-IV-Monsters-for-Meddlesome-Heroes)** - This was a series where multiple different designers submitted villains to form a bank of statblocks for Game Masters. In II, I wrote Prof. Laeroth Rydel, the dorkiest dhampir occultist. In IV, I wrote Groulindar, an unfettered eidolon who is fighting for the freedom of other eidolons.
- **[ToS 1-04 House of Mirrors](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/149417/Legacies-ToS104-House-of-Mirrors?manufacturers_id=5904)** - This is a module I wrote for the Legacies OP campaign, and was my attempt of making a Pathfinder murder mystery that works with the rules, as opposed to against them.

## Game Design

### Pathfinder Adventure Card Game

- **PACG Open** - No link currently, but I wrote the initial draft of the ACG Open for GenCon 2018.
- **[Paizo Unchained](https://paizo.com/threads/rzs2v14p?A-World-of-Despair#1)** - Written for April Fools 2018, this is an ACG Adventure where you square off against various members of the Lone Shark staff. There may be a puzzle in it!
- **[ACG #5-4: Rise from the Wreckage](https://paizo.com/products/btq01wru?Pathfinder-Society-Adventure-Card-Guild-54-Rise-From-the-Wreckage)** - I wrote the story for this adventure and outlined the general mechanics which Keith implemented. This includes a scenario where all the locations are ships!
- **[ACG #4-5: The Pactmaster's Bargain](https://paizo.com/products/btpya05i?Pathfinder-Society-Adventure-Card-Guild-45-The-Pactmasters-Bargain)** - I wrote the story for this adventure and outlined the general mechanics which Keith implemented.

- **[Friends and Enemies](https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5li7z?Homebrew-Scenario-Design-with-Jen-Iammars)** - This was a Paizo blog post where I walked through how I created a scenario in PACG. It's fully playable in the Wrath of the Righteous Adventure Path!
- **[Wayfinder #17](https://paizo.com/products/btpy9tdi?Wayfinder-17)** - In this fanzine, I created a hard mode for the Skull and Shackles adventure path.
- **[Wayfinder #15](http://paizo.com/products/btpy9mr8?Wayfinder-15)** - In this fanzine, I created a short adventure for the Skull and Shackles adventure path meant to give you all the same rewards but in only 2 scenarios instead of 5.
