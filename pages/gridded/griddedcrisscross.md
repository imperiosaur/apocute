## Context

This puzzle was one of the puzzles we wrote to include in our wedding book.

## Hints

{% include spoiler.html id="One" name="How do I get started with this?" content="To start, focus on words that have As and Js in weird patterns. For instance, JACINDA ARDERN has two As in a row and TAJ MAHAL has a lot of As and Js in a small amount of space. Whenever you put a word in the grid, fill in the boxes right in front of and right behind the words so you know that other letters cannot go in them." %}
