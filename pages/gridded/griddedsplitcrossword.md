## Context

This puzzle was one of the puzzles we wrote to include in our wedding book.

## Hints

{% include spoiler.html id="One" name="How do I get started with this?" content="The bottom-left corner is a great place to start here. There are two 5s (one across, one down), a 126, and a 124, and they are forced to be specific pairs of numbers. The Rhode Island specific clue you may want to google, the type of farm is not really a farm, and the consume clue should be thought of in terms of resources. From here you can either start working on potential crossings (how many 5-letter words end in a U?), or look for clues with numbers that are really high or really low." %}
